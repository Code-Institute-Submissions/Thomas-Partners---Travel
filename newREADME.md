#### Typography
Lato font is the main font used throughout thomas and partners site, with Sans Serif as a back up font for any reason Lato isn't improted correctly.Lato is a humanist sans-serif typeface. The name "Lato" is Polish for "summer". As of August 2018, Lato is the third most served font on Google Fonts making it a familiar font without defaulting to Times Roman.

Our images all have a purpose behind them, 
1. the first parallax image is a group of people working together around a table, reflecting the partnership of Thomas and partners bringing people together in order to fill a need or overcome a problem.
2. The second image is a group of people wearing makeshift PPE reflecting that we take our role of looking after our customers and partners seriously. 
3. The third image is a hillside filled with windmills, reflecting how we are aware that the travel industry is detrimental to the environment and that we are committed to minimising the environmental impact our services will have on the environment with a ISO14001.
4. The fourth image is a woman writing code, to reflect that through our partnership our partners will build bespoke travel programmes around the customers' needs.
