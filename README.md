# Thomas & Partners
My Milestone 1 is a marketing website for my fiction travel company called Thomas and Partners. It was designed as a desktop first approach with media queries to make it responsive & accessible on all devices.

## UX

### User stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals
1. My goal is for visitors to easily understand what Thomas & Partners does and easily scroll through and learn about the services we offer. 
2. Visitors should be able to navigate between pages with ease and know exactly where they are on the site.
3. Visitors should be able to find all available avenues to contact us, via phone, email, social media and our physical address.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
1. Returning visitors should be able to find our contact information with ease
2. Returning visitors should be able to find our social media links with ease

#### First Time User 
* As a businessman, I want quick concise information about the company, what services they provide, and how to contact them.

#### Returning Time User 
* I want to be able to find contact information and social media profiles to follow.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
Black and White are the main site colors, as well as blue, green and teal.

#### Typography
Lato font is the main font used throughout Thomas and partners site, with Sans Serif as a backup font for any reason Lato isn't imported correctly.Lato is a humanist sans-serif typeface. The name "Lato'' is Polish for "summer". As of August 2018, Lato is the third most served font on Google Fonts making it a familiar font without defaulting to Times Roman.

#### Imagery
Our images all have a purpose behind them, 
1. The first parallax image is a group of people working together around a table, reflecting the partnership of Thomas and partners bringing people together in order to fill a need or overcome a problem.
2. The second image is a group of people wearing makeshift PPE reflecting that we take our role of looking after our customers and partners seriously. 
3. The third image is a hillside filled with windmills, reflecting how we are aware that the travel industry is detrimental to the environment and that we are committed to minimising the environmental impact our services will have on the environment with a ISO14001.
4. The fourth image is a woman writing code, to reflect that through our partnership our partners will build bespoke travel programmes around the customers' needs. 
5. The fifth and final image is of a conference, to highlight our M.I.C.E Service offering.

## Testing
* Parallax was used on all pages to give an animated effect. When testing I realised that this didn’t work on mobile & tablets so I have used media queries to change the pictures to static when screen size is less than 1200px 
* The footer when on Mobile & Tablet was squashed together and you couldn’t tell where it started and finished. Using Media Queries I made bronze borders for when the screen size is less than 1200px to define each section of the footer. 
* The Service Page image is a woman coding, however the picture was too wide for mobile, I tried to crop it using GIMP 2.1 but it wasn’t very good. I opted to change it to an image of people working from a sheet of paper and a laptop when the screen size is less than 400 px. 
* On the Service page on mobile there is a white streak along the right hand side if you scroll left.
* HTML was tested using [W3C-Markup-Validation-Service:](https://validator.w3.org/) and have no issues. 
* CSS Was tested using [W3C-CSS-Validation-Service:](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and has 1 parse issue.
