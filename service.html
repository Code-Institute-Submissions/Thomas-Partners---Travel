                <p>At Thomas & Partners, we take complex business challenges, simplify them and
                    convert them into real business value. We leave no stone unturned to find potential, even in the
                    highest performing of travel programmes. We deliver travel solutions that support your business as
                    you innovate, expand and enter new markets.</p>
                <p>Extracting the very best from an airline programme
                    requires a comprehensive understanding of macro-economic market conditions, insight into industry
                    trends and an awareness of how these might impact your business. We leave basic fare comparison
                    behind and dig deeper into the complex world of air travel to help you maximise your travel
                    solutions.</p>
                <p>Businesses are expanding internationally, open booking is gaining in popularity and
                    social buying is creating a state of flux in the market. Companies typically underestimate their
                    total spend and the time they need to commit to achieve better value. We capture and analyse your
                    data against defined objectives and benchmark these against your peers, identifying gaps and
                    highlighting opportunities to drive savings and policy adoption.</p>
