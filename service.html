                <p>Relationships and understanding are paramount. That’s why one of the very first things we
                    undertake
                    for our clients on becoming a member of The Gold Club is a personal client profile. A
                    comprehensive
                    and confidential record of your travel preferences, your profile ensures that everything is just
                    so.
                    Your favourite cabin seat, the temperature of your hotel room, goose down pillows or pure wool,
                    we’ll ensure all your preferences are perfectly observed – first time, every time.</p>

            <p>At Thomas & Partners, we take complex business challenges, simplify them and
                convert them into real business value. We leave no stone unturned to find potential, even in the
                highest performing of travel programmes. We deliver travel solutions that support your business
                as
                you innovate, expand and enter new markets.</p>
            <p>Extracting the very best from an airline programme
                requires a comprehensive understanding of macro-economic market conditions, insight into
                industry
                trends and an awareness of how these might impact your business. We leave basic fare comparison
                behind and dig deeper into the complex world of air travel to help you maximise your travel
                solutions.</p>
            <p>Businesses are expanding internationally, open booking is gaining in popularity and
                social buying is creating a state of flux in the market. Companies typically underestimate their
                total spend and the time they need to commit to achieve better value. We capture and analyse
                your
                data against defined objectives and benchmark these against your peers, identifying gaps and
                highlighting opportunities to drive savings and policy adoption.</p>
